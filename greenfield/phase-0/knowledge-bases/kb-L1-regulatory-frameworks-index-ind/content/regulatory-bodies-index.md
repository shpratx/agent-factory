Layer: L1 (enterprise, domain-agnostic). Micro-KB content rules apply:
max 1 line/bullet, max 15 words, no explanations, numbers not words.

JURISDICTION: India. This KB was UK-scoped until 2026-08-21 and was
re-scoped when the deployment's target geography changed. The KB is
domain-agnostic but NOT jurisdiction-agnostic — one geography per
deployment. Serving two geographies needs two KBs, not merged rows.

Two sections. #cross-domain-index maps an activity to its regulator.
#coverage-categories is the sweep list: every category here is either a
constraint or a declared not-applicable entry. Both the checker and its
evaluator read this file, so the sweep and its audit are the same list.

CENTRE/STATE: many Indian regimes bind at BOTH levels — food licensing,
labour, factories, legal metrology, trade licences, professional tax. A
central-law answer alone is incomplete. See the checker prompt's
state-vs-centre edge case.

# Regulatory Bodies Index (Cross-Domain)

## Jurisdiction

**Jurisdiction covered: India (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2: IN).**
Sub-national layers in scope: states and union territories, municipal bodies.
This index covers no other country. An idea targeting a different country
cannot be assessed from it.

Use to identify the correct regulator category before loading a
