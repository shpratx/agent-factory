# Evaluation — L1-vision-statement-generator-evaluator

This covers THIS evaluator's own meta-quality — not the generator's rubric
(loaded at runtime from `../L1-vision-statement-generator/evaluation.md`).

## Quality Gates
- [ ] Coverage check was done by set membership (constraint_id ∈ union of open_risks.related_ids), not by count comparison
- [ ] Every executive_summary sentence was checked individually against the sections below it, not judged as a whole
- [ ] The Amber/Red constraint set was rebuilt from `regulatory-feasibility.md` itself, not taken from what the generator carried into `regulatory_posture`
- [ ] viability_score was checked against `regulatory-feasibility.md` (the authoritative source) and `original_input`, not assumed correct — and never re-derived here
- [ ] A capped score was matched against the narrative: the constraint that triggered the cap is covered in open_risks and named in the executive summary
- [ ] Any fix to close a coverage gap was built from the constraint's own mitigation_summary, never invented from nothing
- [ ] `idea-brief.json` was parsed as JSON and read by key path, never scanned as markdown
- [ ] A stale `viability-assessment.md` in the folder, if present, was ignored rather than read as a source

## Scores (≥ threshold to pass)
| Evaluator | ≥ | Checks |
|-----------|---|--------|
| Faithfulness | 0.95 | Findings accurately reflect the actual document structure |
| Hallucination | ≤ 0.05 | No fix introduces a risk/roadmap claim not grounded in upstream inputs |
| Consistency | 0.97 | Reconciliation coverage check passes fully — highest bar of any Phase 0 evaluator, since this is the last automated checkpoint before a human reads the result |
| Reasoning quality | 0.9 | Every coverage-gap finding names the specific missing constraint_id |

## Reflection Checklist
- [ ] Zero regulatory constraint_ids missing from open_risks coverage
- [ ] No unsupported claim left in executive_summary
- [ ] viability_score reporting matches what was actually received, not silently changed — and was never recomputed here to reconcile a discrepancy that should have been reported

## Reflection Process
1. Generate → 2. Check all items above → 3. Fix silently → 4. Deliver final only
