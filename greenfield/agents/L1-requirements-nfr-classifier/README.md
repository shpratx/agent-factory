# L1-requirements-nfr-classifier

## Purpose

`L1-requirements-prd-composer` and Phase 4's design agents need every
functional requirement's cross-functional constraints — performance,
security, scalability, availability, compliance, usability — resolved to a
real, checkable source before design starts. A fabricated SLA or throughput
number discovered at design time is far more expensive to unwind than one
caught here. This agent is the single point where each `requirements.md` FR
is classified once, consistently, against a real source or an honest
"TBD" — never a plausible-sounding guess.

## What does it do?

Accepts `requirements.md` (from `L1-requirements-elicitor`) and
`regulatory-feasibility.md` (Phase 0's artifact, cited directly) and
produces:
- One NFR-classification entry per functional requirement, tagging only the
  categories that genuinely apply (never a padded fixed six)
- For each applicable category, a boundary condition that is either an
  explicit number/rule grounded in `requirements.md`, `vision.md`,
  `regulatory-feasibility.md`, or `kb-L1-enterprise-security`, or the
  literal "TBD — needs stakeholder input" if genuinely ungrounded

It never invents a number, threshold, or regulation citation not actually
present in a real source, and it never marks something TBD that a group
security policy or the regulatory-feasibility assessment already answers.

## How does it work?

1. Reads every FR in `requirements.md`, in order
2. For each FR, walks `kb-L1-nfr-classification-taxonomy`'s six categories
   and asks that category's question — applies only the categories that are
   genuinely relevant to that FR's statement
3. For each applicable category, checks `requirements.md` (the FR's own
   statement), `vision.md` (e.g. a North-Star Metric target), and
   `regulatory-feasibility.md` for an explicit or directly-implied
   number/rule; checks `kb-L1-enterprise-security` for a group policy that
   already answers a Security/Compliance/Availability question (e.g. a
   retention period or uptime tier) before ever writing TBD
4. Writes the literal "TBD — needs stakeholder input" only when genuinely
   ungrounded — never a fabricated placeholder value
5. Self-checks mechanically: every non-TBD condition carries a specific
   source, every TBD condition carries source "—", ids match
   `requirements.md` exactly
6. Saves the filled `nfr-spec.md` template to blob storage; items carry the
   same facts in full (not condensed — see `output_schema.json`'s own note
   on why this differs from Phase 0's meta-points pattern)

## Input

- **Source:** agent_output (`requirements.md` from `L1-requirements-elicitor`;
  `regulatory-feasibility.md` from `L1-vision-regulatory-feasibility-checker`)
- **Required:** `requirements_output` — the elicitor's full output, status
  must be `success`; `regulatory_feasibility_output` — Phase 0's regulatory
  agent's full output, read directly for Compliance citations, not a KB

## Output

- **Type:** `nfr_classification`
- **Items:** `nfr_classifications[]` — one entry per FR, each with
  `boundary_conditions[]` (`category`, `boundary_condition`, `source`); see
  `output_schema.json`. Boundary conditions are carried in FULL in items,
  not summarized — a boundary condition is already a short, atomic phrase,
  so unlike Phase 0's meta-points pattern there is nothing long to condense
- **Artifacts:** `nfr-spec.md` — the human-readable per-FR table document
- **Metadata:** every classification carries `confidence` and `reasoning`;
  `source` is this agent's citation equivalent for each boundary condition
- **Summary:** FR count classified, categories applied, TBDs left open and
  why, guardrail results, KBs consulted, gaps flagged
