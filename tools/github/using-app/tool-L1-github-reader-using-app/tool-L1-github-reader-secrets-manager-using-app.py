"""
GitHub File Reader Tool for CrewAI — GitHub App Authentication
==============================================================

Functional twin of `tool-L1-github-reader.py`. Same input schema, same output
shape, same error semantics. The ONLY difference is the credential model:

    PAT version                     GitHub App version
    -----------                     ------------------
    Static token `ghp_...`          JWT (RS256, private key) -> installation
                                    access token `ghs_...` (expires in 1 hour)
    GET /user -> owner              GET /installation/repositories -> owner
    Rate limit: 5,000/hr/user       Rate limit: 5,000/hr/installation
                                    (scales up with org size, up to 15,000)

Authentication flow
-------------------
    1. Build a JWT: {iat, exp, iss} signed RS256 with the App's private key.
       `iss` is the App ID (numeric) or the Client ID (`Iv23li...`).
       GitHub caps `exp` at iat + 600s. We use 540s for clock-skew safety.
    2. GET /app/installations  (JWT auth)  -> which accounts installed the App
    3. POST /app/installations/{id}/access_tokens  (JWT auth) -> `ghs_...`
    4. All repo calls use `Authorization: Bearer ghs_...` — identical to a PAT.

    The JWT authenticates *the App*. The installation token authenticates
    *the App acting inside one account*. Only the latter can read repo contents.

Prerequisites
-------------
    pip install "PyJWT[crypto]"

    The [crypto] extra is required -- it pulls in `cryptography`, which
    provides RS256. Plain `pip install PyJWT` installs fine and then fails at
    runtime with "NotImplementedError: Algorithm not supported".

    The App must be installed on the target account, and its permissions must
    include **Repository permissions -> Contents: Read-only** (plus Metadata:
    Read-only, which GitHub adds implicitly). Without Contents, every file
    fetch returns 404 -- indistinguishable from a missing file. Check this
    first if you get mysterious 404s on files you can see in the browser.

Credentials
-----------
    Set the four module-level constants in the CONFIGURATION block below.
    Each falls back to an environment variable if left blank, so the same
    file works for local development and for deployment without edits.

    Note that only APP_ID (or CLIENT_ID) and PRIVATE_KEY are used. The client
    *secret* is not needed at all -- that is exclusively for OAuth
    user-authorization flows, which this tool does not perform.

Signing cost
------------
    RSA signing happens far less often than "every authentication". Two
    caches sit in front of it:

        JWT cache          -> re-signs at most once per ~8 minutes
        Installation token -> re-mints at most once per ~55 minutes

    So a run that fetches 500 files performs zero additional signatures after
    the first. PyJWT with the [crypto] extra signs a 2048-bit key in roughly
    1 ms, making the cost negligible even on a cache miss.

        Note there is no GET /user call. An installation token has no
        associated human, so the PAT tool's owner lookup does not apply; the
        owner comes from the installation's own account instead.

    Rate limits:
        5,000 requests/hour per installation, scaling to 15,000 for larger
        organisations — generally more headroom than a PAT, and it does not
        consume any human's personal quota.
