GitHub File Reader Tool for CrewAI

This module implements a custom CrewAI tool that provides recursive file reading
capabilities from GitHub repositories using the GitHub REST API v3. It allows
authenticated access to repository contents and returns file data in a structured format.

Security Notice:
    ⚠️ CRITICAL: This file contains a hardcoded GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)
    on line 10. This is a security vulnerability and the token should be:
    1. Immediately revoked via GitHub Settings → Developer Settings → Tokens
    2. Moved to environment variables or secure credential storage
    3. Removed from git history if this file has been committed

Dependencies:
    - requests: HTTP library for GitHub API calls
    - pydantic: Data validation using Python type annotations
    - crewai: Framework for building AI agent tools
    - urllib.parse: URL encoding for API paths
    - base64: Decoding GitHub API's base64-encoded file contents

Typical Usage:
    >>> from github_file_reader import GithubReader
    >>> tool = GithubReader()
    >>> result = tool._run(
    ...     folder_location="src/components",
    ...     repo="my-repo",
    ...     branch="main"
    ... )
    >>> print(result["files"])

def _fetch_github_repo_owner(token: str) -> str:
    """
    Fetch the authenticated GitHub user's login name using the provided token.

    This function makes an authenticated request to the GitHub API's /user endpoint
    to retrieve the username associated with the provided Personal Access Token.
    This is necessary because the tool needs to construct repository URLs in the
    format "owner/repo", but only receives the repo name from the user.

    Args:
        token (str): GitHub Personal Access Token with appropriate scopes.
                    At minimum, requires 'repo' scope for private repositories
                    or 'public_repo' scope for public repositories only.

    Returns:
        str: The GitHub username (login) associated with the token.
            Example: "varun-ascendion" or "octocat"

    Raises:
        requests.exceptions.HTTPError: If the API request fails (e.g., invalid token,
                                      network issues, rate limiting)
        requests.exceptions.Timeout: If the request exceeds 30 seconds
        KeyError: If the API response doesn't contain the expected 'login' field

    API Reference:
        https://docs.github.com/en/rest/users/users#get-the-authenticated-user

    Example:

class GithubReaderSchema(BaseModel):
    """
    Pydantic input schema for the GithubReader tool.

    This schema defines and validates the three required parameters for reading
    files from a GitHub repository. Pydantic provides automatic validation,
    serialization, and documentation generation. The Field() descriptors are
    used by CrewAI agents to understand how to invoke the tool correctly.

    Attributes:
        folder_location (str): Path to the folder within the repository to read
                              recursively. Should not include leading/trailing slashes
                              as they are normalized by the tool.
                              Examples:
                                - "src" → reads all files under /src/
                                - "docs/api" → reads all files under /docs/api/
                                - "." or "" → reads entire repository (root level)

        repo (str): Repository name WITHOUT the owner prefix. The owner is automatically
                   determined by querying the authenticated user endpoint using the token.
                   Examples:
                     - "scib_demo" (not "varun-ascendion/scib_demo")
                     - "my-project-repo"
                     - "CrewAI-Tools"

        branch (str): Git branch name to read files from. Can be:
                     - Standard branch names: "main", "master", "develop"
                     - Feature branches: "feature/SCRUM-11691", "bugfix/issue-123"
                     - Tag names: "v1.0.0", "release-2.3"
                     Note: Must match exact branch name (case-sensitive)

    Validation:
        - All fields are required (Pydantic Field with ... as default)
        - All fields must be strings
        - Additional validation happens in GithubReader._run() method

    Usage by CrewAI Agents:
        Agents use the Field descriptions to understand parameter semantics
        and generate appropriate values when invoking the tool autonomously.

    """
    CrewAI tool for recursively reading all files from a GitHub repository folder.

    This tool extends CrewAI's BaseTool to provide agents with the ability to
    read and retrieve file contents from GitHub repositories. It uses the GitHub
    REST API v3 to authenticate, navigate repository structures, and download
    file contents. All files are decoded from base64 and returned as UTF-8 text.

    The tool performs the following operations:
    1. Validates input parameters
    2. Authenticates with GitHub and resolves repository owner
    3. Verifies repository and branch existence
    4. Retrieves the complete file tree for the branch
    5. Filters files under the specified folder
    6. Downloads and decodes each file's content
    7. Returns structured results with status indicators

    Class Attributes:
        name (str): Human-readable tool name displayed to agents
        description (str): Natural language description of tool capabilities,
                          used by agents to decide when to invoke this tool
        args_schema (Type[BaseModel]): Pydantic schema for input validation

    Methods:
        _run(folder_location, repo, branch): Main execution method (see below)

    Rate Limiting:
        GitHub API has rate limits:
        - Authenticated: 5,000 requests/hour
        - Unauthenticated: 60 requests/hour
        This tool uses authentication, but be aware of limits when processing
        large repositories or running in tight loops.

    API Endpoints Used:
        1. GET /user - Fetch authenticated user
        2. GET /repos/{owner}/{repo} - Verify repository exists
        3. GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path} - Check folder exists
        4. GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/{branch} - Get tree SHA
        5. GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/trees/{sha}?recursive=1 - Get file tree
        6. GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path} - Download each file

    Example Output Structure:
        {
            "repository": "varun-ascendion/scib_demo",
            "branch": "main",

        Execute the GitHub file reading operation.

        This method orchestrates the complete workflow of authenticating with GitHub,
        navigating to the specified folder, retrieving all file contents recursively,
        and returning them in a structured format. It handles various edge cases
        including missing folders, binary files, and API errors.

        Workflow:
            1. Input Validation: Ensure folder_location is a non-empty string
            2. Authentication: Use token to fetch repository owner
            3. Repository Verification: Confirm repo exists and is accessible
            4. Folder Verification: Check that the target folder exists in the branch
            5. Tree Retrieval: Get complete recursive file tree from branch
            6. File Filtering: Identify all files under the target folder
            7. Content Download: Fetch and decode each file's content
            8. Result Aggregation: Build structured response dictionary

        Args:
            folder_location (str): Repository folder path (e.g., "src/components", "docs")
                                  Leading/trailing slashes are automatically stripped
            repo (str): Repository name without owner (e.g., "scib_demo")
            branch (str): Branch name (e.g., "main", "feature/xyz")

        Returns:
            dict | str: On success, returns a dictionary with structure:
                {
                    "repository": str,        # "owner/repo" format
                    "branch": str,            # Branch name

                    "message": str (optional) # Present if no files found
                }

                Each file in "files" dict has one of these structures:

                    "message": str
                }

                On error, returns a string error message instead of dict.

        Raises:
            Does not raise exceptions directly; all errors are caught and returned
            as formatted error strings to ensure CrewAI agents receive actionable
            error messages.

        Error Handling:
            - Network errors: Captured with response status/text
            - API errors: HTTP status codes translated to messages
            - Decode errors: Binary files flagged with special status
            - Missing resources: 404s return descriptive error messages

        Performance Considerations:
            - Uses recursive tree API to minimize requests (1 call for entire tree)
            - Downloads files individually (unavoidable with Contents API)
            - Large folders may hit rate limits or take significant time
            - Consider pagination for repositories with >1000 files

        Example Success:
            >>> tool = GithubReader()
